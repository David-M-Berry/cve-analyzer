# cve-analyzer
Collect, analyze and notify vendors of CVEs

## Intended Usage
The intention of this project is to search for CVEs by vendor.

The vendor can be notified when new CVEs are logged, and when they do not have a corresponding GitHub issue reference (indicating the CVE has also been logged as an issue). 

This should help vendor awareness of CVEs, as well as ensure GitHub issues are logged for each CVE. 

## Instructions

Consider using this with an API key from NIST, this will avoid avoud lower rate limits for requests.

Set the api key as an environment variable:

`export API_KEY="your api key"`

Run the script with the vendor name as an argument:

`./vendor-cve-checker-url-builder.py tinyproxy`
